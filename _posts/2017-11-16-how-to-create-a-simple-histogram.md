## How many unique users were created each month

### SQL query

```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_at) as year,
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created_at) as month,
       COUNT(DISTINCT(email)),
       LPAD('', (COUNT(DISTINCT(email))/100)::int, '#') as frequency
FROM users
GROUP BY 1,2;
```

### Result
