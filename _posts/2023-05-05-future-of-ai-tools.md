🤖 I read that more than 2,000 startups are doing something related to AI/LLM, which is a huge number in a short time since we're only just beginning to see what this technology can do. However, as with every hype, the majority of these startups will likely be out of business within a year or two, just as we saw with blockchain and related technologies.

🏆 So, who is going to win this hype? I see two categories:

1️⃣ The first category is those who can seamlessly integrate AI into existing workflows or put magic (as we call it in Productboard 🚀) into their products. Notion's AI assistant for writers is an excellent example of this. The next level example in this category, and it'll take more time, is those who can integrate it into their ecosystems, and for sure, those are Apple, Microsoft, or Salesforce. We already see some sparks in the macOS or MS Teams. It'll take them more time because, by nature, they aren't as fast as startups. They win because users don't care if there is AI; they want to get stuff done with the tools they already have.

2️⃣ The second category is highly specialized tools and conversation assistants trained on top of niche fields, such as 🧑‍⚖️ law, 🧑‍⚕️ medicine, or 🧑‍🔬 science. These tools won't replace the professionals in these fields, but they can significantly help them to do better jobs because their fields are incredibly complex. These tools and assistants can help professionals sort through vast amounts of data and information, making their work more efficient and effective.
